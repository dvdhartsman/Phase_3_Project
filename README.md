# Phase_3_Project
# Tanzanian Water Pipe Predictions
### David Hartsman
### Overview
In this project, I was challenged to develop predictive models capable of determining the status of water pumps in Tanzania. There were three distinct classes that I needed to predict: functional, functional-needs-repair, and non-functional. By using an iterative process of adjusting features, sampling techniques, and hyper-parameters, I endeavored to find the most accurate predictive model.
